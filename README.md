# YouTube Clone

## Project Overview
YouTube Clone is a web application that mimics the user interface and functionality of YouTube. Built with HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS, this project showcases a responsive layout featuring a header, sidebar, and a main content area displaying video thumbnails and information.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-clone.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-clone
   ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser** to view the application:
   ```bash
   open index.html  # or use your preferred method to open HTML files
   ```

## Usage
Once the `index.html` file is opened in your browser, you will see the YouTube Clone interface, featuring a header, sidebar with navigation items, and a grid of video thumbnails. The application is fully responsive and provides a fluid user experience on desktops and mobile devices.

## Features
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Interactive header with a search bar and icons for user actions.
- Sidebar navigation for quick access to different sections (Home, Explore, Shorts, Subscriptions, History, Watch Later).
- Display of video thumbnails with titles, views count, and upload time.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following external libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used throughout the application.

You can find the CSS and script files linked in the `<head>` section of `index.html`:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css">
```

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
youtube-clone/
│
├── index.html          // Main HTML file
```
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and layout of the YouTube Clone application, including head, body, and content components.

This simple structure allows for easy modifications and enhancements to various parts of the application as needed.
